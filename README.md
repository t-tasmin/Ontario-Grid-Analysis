# Electricity Demand and Supply Analysis in Ontario

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **Ontario’s electricity demand and supply** to understand current trends and how energy needs might evolve in the future. 
Using **Python** and **Power BI**, I explored historical demand patterns, examined the contribution of different fuel types, and identified key insights to 
inform future energy planning.

**Goal:** Understand electricity demand and supply patterns in Ontario and provide actionable insights for energy planning.

## Data Source
Data for this project was obtained from the **IESO Open Data Portal**: [https://www.ieso.ca/power-data/data-directory](https://www.ieso.ca/power-data/data-directory)

## Tools & Technologies
- **IDE:** VS Code with Jupyter Notebook  
- **Data Cleaning & Processing:** NumPy, Pandas  
- **Data Visualization:** Bokeh, Matplotlib, Power BI  

## Analysis Conducted
1. **Energy Demand Analysis**
   - Examined **annual average electricity demand trends** from 2002 to 2025.  
2. **Energy Supply Analysis**
   - Analyzed **energy supply by fuel type**.  
   - Calculated **total energy supply for each fuel** for years 2021–2025.  
3. **Insights & AI-based Future Steps**
   - Identified key patterns in supply and demand.  
   - Suggested AI-driven forecasting approaches for future energy planning.

## Key Findings
- Trends in electricity demand over the last two decades.  
- Contribution of different fuel types to Ontario’s energy mix.  
- Patterns indicating potential areas for energy optimization and forecasting using AI.  

## Usage
- Clone this repository and open the Jupyter Notebook in VS Code to explore data analysis scripts.  
- Power BI dashboards are included for interactive visualization of demand and supply trends.
